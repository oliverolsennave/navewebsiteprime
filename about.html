            <p class="vision-text">
                Catholic communities are everywhere — parishes, schools, missionaries, retreats, businesses — but they're rarely <strong>visible</strong>. Finding your Catholic neighborhood shouldn't require word of mouth, Google searches, and guesswork. Nave maps the dots so you can connect them.

                    <p class="founder-story">
                        After getting married in college, our founder and his wife faced a common challenge: finding Catholic community in a new city. Moving to Philadelphia revealed a rich but fragmented Catholic ecosystem — countless parishes, schools, and organizations, yet no clear way to navigate them. That gap between abundance and accessibility became the foundation for Nave.

                    <p class="founder-story">
                        With seven years as an international missionary with the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS), our co-founder brings deep experience building community across cultures and geographies. From language barriers to unfamiliar parish structures, he witnessed firsthand how difficult it can be for anyone to find their place in the Church — and built Nave to change that.
