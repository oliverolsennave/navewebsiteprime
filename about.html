            <p class="vision-text">
                Catholic communities are everywhere — parishes, schools, missionaries, retreats, businesses — but they're rarely <strong>visible</strong>. Finding your Catholic neighborhood shouldn't require word of mouth, Google searches, and guesswork. Nave maps the dots so you can connect them.

                    <p class="founder-story">
                        Our founder got married during college. After graduating, he and his wife struggled to find Catholic community. Where were the parishes? The young adult groups? Moving to Philadelphia, he was amazed by the depth of Catholic infrastructure — yet still couldn't figure out where to put down roots. Too many options, too little clarity. That frustration became the seed of Nave — a tool to help every Catholic find their neighborhood.

                    <h3 class="founder-title">The Mission Man</h3>
                    <p class="founder-story">
                        Our co-founder spent 7 years as a Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS) international missionary — learning new languages, adapting to unfamiliar cultures, and navigating countless roadblocks to getting plugged in and sharing the Gospel. He saw how hard it can be for anyone, missionary or newcomer, to find their place in a Catholic community. Nave makes it easier for the Church to open her doors wide to everyone who seeks her.
