                Catholic communities are everywhere — parishes, schools, missionaries, retreats, businesses — but they're rarely <strong>visible</strong>. Finding your Catholic neighborhood shouldn't require word of mouth, Google searches, and guesswork. Nave maps the dots so you can connect them.

                        When deciding where to raise a family, one thing became clear: proximity to strong Catholic community matters. But finding that community — the right parish, school, and network of support — proved surprisingly difficult. Nave was built to help families make informed decisions about where to put down roots and grow together in faith.

                    <p class="founder-story">
                        Seven years as an international missionary with the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS) revealed a consistent challenge: helping people find their place in the Church. From language barriers to unfamiliar parish structures, the difficulty of connecting newcomers to Catholic community became the driving force behind Nave.
